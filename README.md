Problem Statement

Our sponsor’s organisations wants to develop an application that will improve
their production time, handling of calls which are essentially issues an
employee logs and keep track of operations.

Sponsor Background

Altech Card Solutions was created in the year 1993 and now is one of the
leading players in the secure of transactions markets, Public transport
Solutions, Mobile forms, Crypto Services and Information Security Services
under the CyberTech division. CyberTech is a managed cyber security service
provider with over 15 years’ experience providing services in many African
countries as well as Europe.
Our sponsor’s current system only provides means to only track tickets and not
enforce them not to be closed without a reason and they do not get
notifications when the ticket is almost due has still providing the same problem
of not meeting project deadlines and seeing where the company is lacking
which our system will provide and try to maintain.
